# Hotel-summarization

# Business Objective
The primary objective of this project is to enhance the customer experience by delivering personalized hotel recommendations. By analyzing a vast corpus of customer reviews, the system identifies the most relevant feedback based on specific user queries, summarizes key points, and recommends hotels that best match the user's needs and preferences.

# Key Features
## 1. Query-Based Review Filtering
Users can input specific queries, such as "best family-friendly hotels in Paris" or "hotels with great Wi-Fi in New York."
The system intelligently filters through thousands of reviews to identify those most relevant to the user's query.


## 2. Advanced Review Summarization
The filtered reviews are summarized to highlight the key points, making it easier for users to quickly understand the general sentiment and important aspects of the hotels.
Summarization focuses on aspects like service quality, amenities, location, cleanliness, and overall customer satisfaction.


## 3. Tailored Hotel Recommendations
Based on the summarized reviews, the system provides a ranked list of hotel recommendations that best align with the userâ€™s query.
Each recommendation includes a brief overview of why the hotel is a good match, focusing on the strengths identified in customer reviews.


## 4. Enhanced Decision-Making
The system empowers users to make more informed decisions by providing them with clear, concise, and relevant information.
This reduces the time spent sifting through countless reviews and increases confidence in booking decisions.
