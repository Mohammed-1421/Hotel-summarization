Also enjoyed the bar where they make incredible cocktails and have a nice happy hour (4-7p)\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rate\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.1724493011383668,\n        \"min\": 1.0,\n        \"max\": 5.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4.0,\n          2.0,\n          3.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"tripdate\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 76,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \" January 2020\",\n          \" January 2021\",\n          \" November 2021\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"hotel_url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 600,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293974-d294607-Reviews-or20-InterContinental_Istanbul-Istanbul.html\",\n          \"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d7255276-Reviews-or30-The_Knickerbocker-New_York_City_New_York.html\",\n          \"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187147-d197985-Reviews-or10-Pullman_Paris_Eiffel_Tower_Hotel-Paris_Ile_de_France.html\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"hotel_image\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 150,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/26/37/24/88/gb-exterior.jpg\",\n          \"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/2b/43/07/07/exterior.jpg\",\n          \"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/29/38/be/d3/empire-hotel-new-york.jpg\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"price_range\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)\",\n          \"$$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)\",\n          \"$$$ (Based on Average Nightly Rates for a Standard Room from our Partners)\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rating_value\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.4327574208245527,\n        \"min\": 3.0,\n        \"max\": 5.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4.5,\n          3.5,\n          4.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"review_count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 3771,\n        \"min\": 39,\n        \"max\": 24877,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 147,\n        \"samples\": [\n          3755,\n          1878,\n          471\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"street_address\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 150,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Willing House 356-364 Gray's Inn Road Willings House\",\n          \"Kemalpasa Mah.
